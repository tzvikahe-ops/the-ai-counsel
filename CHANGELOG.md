# Changelog

All notable changes to The AI Counsel will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.13.1+he.1] - 2026-09-28

> Hebrew edition fully synced with upstream through v0.13.1: custom advisor personas
> (create/edit/delete from Advisor Setup, with deletion cleaned up from saved presets),
> configurable backend/frontend ports (`PORT_BACKEND` / `PORT_FRONTEND`), configurable
> Anthropic/OpenCode token limits and per-provider request timeouts, fixes for Anthropic
> reasoning-model preflight and thinking-token budgets, OpenCode Go session reuse, a
> published GHCR Docker image, and ChatGPT OAuth support for GPT-5.6 Luna. The custom
> persona editor (name/role/description/system-prompt fields, create/delete
> confirmations) is fully localized for Hebrew; custom persona names, roles, and system
> prompts stay exactly as the user typed them in either language, matching how built-in
> personas already work. Docker instructions in `README.md` and `docs/DOCKER.md` now
> point at this fork's own GHCR image (`ghcr.io/tzvikahe-ops/the-ai-counsel`) instead of
> upstream's.

## [0.11.4+he.1] - 2026-09-28

> Hebrew edition synced with upstream through v0.11.4: accessible font size (Default
> 110% / Large 150%, applied via a `--font-scale` CSS variable across the whole app,
> including our Sage light theme), a release version-consistency check, GPU/animation
> fixes (landing-page orbs, Settings backdrop blur, Stage 3 verdict sheen, docked chat
> composer), and a trimmed MCP `instructions` block. The font-size selector and its
> hint text are localized for Hebrew.

### Fixed
- **Version drift risk**: Adopted upstream's `scripts/check_version_consistency.py` and switched this fork's version format to `X.Y.Z+he.N` (valid semver build metadata and PEP 440 local version) on every surface so the checker passes.

## [0.11.0+he.1] - 2026-09-28

> Hebrew edition synced with upstream through v0.11.0: unified credential storage
> (encrypted file or OS keystore), Subscription OAuth logins (xAI SuperGrok, ChatGPT
> Plus/Pro, GitHub Copilot), opt-in relay-ai credential import, Disconnect / Disconnect
> All Providers, and per-provider Disconnect buttons. All new Settings UI (credential
> storage picker, OAuth device-code flow, relay-ai import, disconnect confirmations) is
> fully localized for Hebrew and styled for the Sage light theme.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- ChatGPT OAuth now live-fetches models from the Codex backend (same path as relay-ai) and includes **GPT-5.6 Luna**, which requires the Responses-Lite WebSocket transport. Searching for Luna no longer only matches OpenRouter.
- Codex model listing now sends the required `client_version` query param so Counsel no longer falls back to ChatGPT-web (`-wm`) slugs that fail at inference.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Backend and frontend listen ports can be set with `PORT_BACKEND` and `PORT_FRONTEND` in the root `.env`. Defaults stay **8001** and **5173**. `LLM_COUNCIL_BIND_PORT` still overrides the backend port when set. In Docker, leaving `BACKEND_HOST` empty uses the page origin so a runtime `PORT_BACKEND` change does not require rebuilding the image (PR [#26](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/26)). Thanks [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden)!
- Anthropic (and OpenCode) output token limits are configurable via `ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS` / `OPENCODE_MAX_TOKENS`. The Anthropic default is now 32000 so reasoning models have room to think and still write an answer (PR [#27](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/27)). Thanks [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden)!
- Per-provider HTTP timeouts via `LLM_COUNCIL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` and `{PROVIDER}_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (default 180s). Timeout failures now name the limit and how to raise it instead of showing "Unknown error" (PR [#28](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/28)). Thanks [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden)!

### Fixed
- Running the test suite no longer deletes saved API keys from the OS keyring or rewrites the developer's `data/settings.json` (PR [#24](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/24)). Thanks [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden)!
- Anthropic reasoning models no longer fail preflight with a bare `'text'` error when a thinking block arrives before the answer (PR [#25](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/25)). Thanks [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden)!
- Anthropic requests no longer exhaust a hardcoded 4096-token budget on thinking and return no visible answer (PR [#27](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/27)). Thanks [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden)!

### Thanks
- Thanks to [@nodeGarden](https://github.com/nodeGarden) for contributing PRs [#24](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/24), [#25](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/25), [#26](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/26), [#27](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/27), and [#28](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/28).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- OpenCode Go requests now reuse each Counsel conversation's session ID across all inference stages and retries, send the identifying Counsel user agent, and propagate that identity through council, debate, advisor, preflight, title, and search-query calls.

### Deployment
- Restart the backend when upgrading so OpenCode Go requests begin sending the automatic session identification and Counsel user agent.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Custom advisor personas can be created, edited, and deleted from Advisor Setup, with REST endpoints for integrations.

### Fixed
- Deleting a custom advisor now removes its persona ID and per-persona model assignment from all saved advisor presets.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Docked the chat composer below the scrollable conversation and corrected its narrow-screen spacing so responses remain readable while typing.
- Replaced the Stage 3 verdict sheen's layout-triggering animation with compositor-friendly transforms to reduce sustained rendering work.

### Thanks
- Thanks to [@markc647](https://github.com/markc647) for contributing PRs [#20](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/20) and [#21](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/21).

## [0.11.3] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- Stopped the landing-page gradient orbs from continuously animating and removed the Settings backdrop blurs, eliminating sustained Chromium GPU-process load on affected Windows systems while preserving the static glow, glass styling, transitions, and hover effects.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-08-02

### Changed
- Trimmed the MCP server `instructions` block from ~1,130 to ~475 characters. Clients re-send the whole block on every reconnect, and agent harnesses that spawn a fresh CLI process per turn pay that cost on each turn. The removed per-tool roster duplicated the action lists each tool's own description already carries; the cross-cutting facts (`provider:model` prefixes, `documents` handling, REST reference) are kept.
- Added a release version-consistency check covering backend metadata, MCP runtime metadata, frontend metadata, the sidebar, skill frontmatter, and the changelog release heading.
- Made the MCP package version resolve from the canonical project metadata instead of maintaining a separate hardcoded value.

### Fixed
- MCP initialization now advertises The AI Counsel app version (`0.11.2`) instead of the Python MCP SDK version.

### Deployment
- The shorter MCP `instructions` block only reaches clients after the backend process is restarted. Long-running self-hosted deployments serving `/mcp/sse` keep sending the old block until then - restart them as part of rolling out this release.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- Accessible font-size preference under Settings → General → Display Preferences. Default uses 110% of the previous baseline and Large uses 150%; the choice applies to all UI text, including existing chats, and saves automatically.

### Changed
- Removed the oversized xLarge option. Existing saved xLarge preferences safely fall back to Default.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-18
### Added
- Subscription OAuth providers: xAI SuperGrok (`xai-oauth:`), ChatGPT Plus/Pro (`openai-oauth:`), and GitHub Copilot (`github-copilot:`) via device-code login in Settings.
- Unified credential storage for API keys and OAuth tokens: text file (`data/credentials.json`) or OS keystore (desktop only; service `the-ai-counsel`), with migrate-on-switch from Settings → LLM API Keys.
- Opt-in import of credentials discovered from relay-ai's OS keystore (Settings → General; Claude Code / Antigravity never imported), with green success confirmation and auto-enable of imported providers.
- Settings → Backup & Reset → **Disconnect All Providers** clears every stored API key / OAuth login and disables provider toggles (keeps council config and prompts).
- Per-provider **Disconnect** on LLM API Keys and Search providers (same pattern as custom endpoint / OAuth).
- Cost reporting treats subscription OAuth runs as free with an explanatory note (not catalog USD estimates).
- User guide [`docs/CREDENTIALS.md`](docs/CREDENTIALS.md) covering storage modes, Disconnect, env overrides, and relay-ai import vs Keychain migration.

### Changed
- API keys and OAuth secrets are no longer stored inline in `settings.json` after upgrade; admin export includes a `credentials` section; saves always redact secret fields.
- Credential storage mode (file vs OS keystore) lives under Settings → LLM API Keys, not Backup & Reset.
- Opt-in relay-ai credential import lives under Settings → General, not Backup & Reset.
- Ollama Settings match other providers: Connect enables it, Retest when already enabled, Disconnect disables it.
- Sidebar credit shows GitHub user `jacob-bd` instead of a full legal name.
- Credential storage UI labels the file option **Local file (data volume)** (not “Encrypted”) — `data/credentials.json` is plaintext JSON with restricted permissions (`0600`), not encryption at rest.

### Fixed
- GitHub Copilot model picker now filters to models enabled for the signed-in plan (`model_picker_enabled` / policy), so Free/Student users no longer see premium models that fail with `model_not_supported`.
- Included Copilot models are labeled `· Free` in the model list (via `billing.multiplier == 0` or known included model IDs).
- Copilot Auto router aliases (`*-auto` / `*-free-auto`) and non-chat models are hidden from the picker - they are not callable via chat/completions.
- Hide `gpt-5-mini` from the Copilot picker on Free/Student: chat often returns `model_not_supported` even though the catalog lists it (use `gpt-4.1` / `gpt-4o` instead).
- Detect GitHub Copilot Free vs paid via `GET /copilot_internal/user` (`access_type_sku` / `copilot_plan`); Free/Student use a strict chat allowlist, paid users get the full filtered catalog; Settings shows Free/Paid plan next to Copilot.
- Disconnect for API keys now clears the credential store and ignores env overrides (e.g. `OPENCODE_API_KEY`) until a new key is saved - fixes Disconnect appearing to do nothing when a key was injected via the environment.
- Retest for imported/stored API keys now reads from the credential store instead of empty `settings.json` fields - fixes "No API key provided or configured" after relay-ai import.
- Settings backup/reset tests isolate (and mock) credential wipe so they cannot clear a developer's real `data/credentials.json`.

## [0.10.5+he.1] - 2026-09-28

> Hebrew edition synced with upstream through v0.10.5 (Ruff dev tooling, conversation
> title repair, preflight rate-limit resilience, auto-enable API connectors, text file
> uploads with optional PDF OCR, MCP SSE heartbeat fix, and persisted one-shot API runs).
> All new UI surfaces (document attach/remove, upload warnings and errors) are fully
> localized for Hebrew and styled for the Sage light theme.

### Fixed
- **Docs: rollup/node_modules startup failure**: Clarified the Troubleshooting note in `README.md`, `README.he.md`, and `AGENTS.md` for the `vite` startup error `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-<platform>` (npm optional-dependencies bug, npm/cli#4828). The fix now also deletes `frontend/package-lock.json` alongside `node_modules` - without removing the lockfile, `npm install` rebuilds the same broken dependency tree. Broadened the trigger description beyond Intel/Apple Silicon Mac switching to include iCloud sync and interrupted installs.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Cleaned up backend and MCP test import placement to resolve the affected Ruff violations.

### Fixed
- `POST /api/ask` now saves every successful one-shot run as a UI-visible conversation, including attachments, search metadata, stage results, and cost data.
- One-shot REST responses now return `conversation_id`, and MCP quick model chat propagates the same ID.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Miscellaneous backend improvements and backend test updates.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- True background heartbeat for MCP SSE streams to prevent 60s client read timeouts during silent inference steps (like Stage 2 and Stage 3).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **MCP SSE stream timeouts**: Fixed an issue where long-running deliberations over remote MCP SSE connections (e.g., via `alef-agent`) were cancelled after 60 seconds due to client-side read timeouts. A new stream interceptor now emits continuous heartbeat `notifications/progress` messages, allowing full 3-stage deliberations to complete successfully.
- **OpenCode test assertion**: Fixed an incorrect header assertion in `test_opencode_provider.py` which checked for `Authorization` instead of the expected `x-api-key`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Text file uploads**: Council, iterative debate, advisor debate, REST, MCP, and UI flows now accept extracted text documents and PDFs. The backend exposes `/api/documents/extract` for multipart UI uploads and `/api/documents/extract-json` for MCP/JSON base64 extraction.
- **PDF extraction with optional OCR**: PDF text extraction uses `pdfplumber`; OCR is optional and gated by `LLM_COUNCIL_OCR_ENABLED=1` plus OCRmyPDF/Tesseract/Ghostscript/qpdf availability.
- **Attachment metadata in history**: Stored conversations keep attachment metadata only, not raw files or extracted text.

### Fixed
- **Claude MCP SSE setup docs**: Claude Code registration examples now use `claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>`, matching the installed Claude CLI.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Auto-enable API connectors**: Settings key validation tests for Ollama, OpenRouter, Groq, Custom OpenAI, and Direct connections now automatically toggle on and enable the provider on successful connection tests.

### Fixed
- **Stray ReferenceError**: Fixed a ReferenceError `activeConversationIdRef is not defined` that dropped council question submissions at the API call stage.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Ruff dev tooling**: Added Ruff to the Python dev dependency group so lint checks run through `uv run ruff`.

### Fixed
- **Conversation title repair**: New and existing conversations with default/empty titles now derive a readable title from the first user message without overwriting explicit custom titles. Contributed by **@insane66613** ([PR #3](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/3)).
- **Preflight rate-limit resilience**: Transient rate-limit preflight failures are retried and soft-failed so otherwise valid models are not dropped from a council run. Contributed by **@insane66613** ([PR #4](https://github.com/jacob-bd/the-ai-counsel/pull/4)).
- **Plain 503 preflight handling**: A bare `503 Service Unavailable` remains a hard preflight failure unless the response body indicates rate limiting, quota, throttling, temporary congestion, or a similar transient condition.

## [0.9.0-he.1] - 2026-06-06

> Hebrew (RTL) edition - fork of upstream v0.9.0 with localization and a new light theme. No upstream features were removed; English mode is preserved as a togglable UI language.

### Added
- **Full Hebrew (he) UI localization with RTL layout**: All user-facing strings - landing page, sidebar, chat, stages 1-4, council grid + setup, advisors, debate view, claim cards, ranking heatmap, round navigator, cost report, and all 8 Settings sections - translated and laid out right-to-left. Model IDs, code blocks, URLs, and numbers stay LTR via a global `.ltr` utility.
- **i18n infrastructure**: `react-i18next` with `he.json` (default) and `en.json` (fallback). UI language preference persists in `localStorage` and toggling it auto-updates `<html lang>` and `dir`.
- **UI language switch in Settings → General**: Dedicated "שפת הממשק / Interface Language" section above date format. Distinct from the existing "Response Language" that controls model output.
- **Sage light theme**: A warm calm-modern palette (forest green `#15803D` primary, copper `#9A3412` chairman, cream `#F0EEE6` body) replacing the previous cool-blue light theme. Pairs with the existing dark "Midnight Glass" via the existing theme toggle.
- **Localized advisor personas (display layer)**: All 12 built-in personas - Skeptic, Pragmatist, Innovator, Historian, Ethicist, Data Analyst, Contrarian, Strategist, Humanist, Risk Assessor, Comedian, Economist - get Hebrew name/role/description in the gallery, the edit modal, the advisor grid, and the debate view. System prompts stay English per project convention.
- **Hebrew advisor prompts**: Pre-translated variants of `ADVISOR_ROUND1_PROMPT`, `ADVISOR_FOLLOWUP_PROMPT`, `ADVISOR_CROSS_POLLINATION_PROMPT`, `ADVISOR_TIEBREAKER_PROMPT`, `ADVISOR_VERDICT_PROMPT`, and `CONSENSUS_TAG_INSTRUCTION`. Selected automatically when `response_language == "Hebrew"` and the user has not customized the prompt in Settings. Section headings are baked into the prompt as `## עמדה`, `## הפרכה`, `## אות הסכמה`, `## סיכום`, `## נקודות הסכמה`, `## חילוקי דעות`, `## פסיקה`, `## צעדים הבאים מומלצים`, `## אי-ודאויות פתוחות`. The verdict table is provided in Hebrew with columns `נושא | עמדה א | עמדה ב | הטיעון החזק יותר`.
- **Hebrew persona names in transcripts**: `_format_transcript` and `_format_debate_arc` swap `persona.name` and `persona.role` to their Hebrew equivalents (`The Skeptic` → `הספקן`, `Critical Thinker` → `חושב ביקורתי`, etc.) when the response language is Hebrew, so advisors address each other by their Hebrew names instead of switching back to English mid-debate.

### Changed
- **`apply_response_language` instruction strengthened**: Now explicitly tells the model to translate every markdown heading, table column header, list label, and section title - covering structural English wording embedded in prompt templates (`## Summary`, `Consensus Points`, etc.). The `CONSENSUS_SCORE: N` sentinel and inline code stay in their original form so the consensus parser keeps working.
- **Default UI language is Hebrew (he)** - English is still available via Settings → Interface Language → English.

### Fixed
- **Sage light theme readability across all surfaces**: Hardcoded dark `rgba(15, 23, 42, ...)` / `rgba(30, 41, 59, ...)` backgrounds in CostReport, Stage 1/2 tab content, Council Grid card states (active/done/waiting), Debate mode list cards (free-form/paragraph/claim), Advisor Grid, DebateView (live status, response cards, verdict, tiebreaker), AdvisorSetup (sections, modals, persona gallery), Claim Cards, Ranking Heatmap, and Round Navigator now have light-theme overrides that respect the Sage palette.
- **Advisor persona edit button**: Moved from bottom-right to top-left of each persona card so it no longer overlaps the end of the Hebrew description text (which wraps to the visual left in RTL).
- **DebateView live-status text contrast**: The bold title (`<strong>`) inside the orange "Preparing advisor panel…" banner is now deep copper instead of pale lavender so it's readable on the Sage cream background.
- **Sidebar cost pill**: Switched from dark-theme gold (`#fbbf24`, invisible on cream) to deep copper text on a saturated copper-tint background.

### Notes
- This release adds languages on top of existing functionality. The wire format, settings file format, persona file format, and all APIs are unchanged. A user can switch the UI to English and the model response language to English to get the original behavior.
- Stage 3 (chairman synthesis) and Stage 4 (corrected draft) in the council flow rely on the strengthened `apply_response_language` instruction. If those stages still leak English headings under heavy English-pretrained models, the same pre-translated-template pattern used for the advisor verdict can be applied - left as future work.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Configurable date format**: Conversation timestamps in the sidebar can be set to Auto (browser locale), MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, or YYYY-MM-DD via Settings → General → Display Preferences. The setting is retroactive - all existing conversations update immediately.
- **General settings section**: Display preferences (date format) and response language moved out of Backup & Reset into a dedicated General section at the top of Settings.
- **Response language setting**: Council and advisor model outputs can be pinned to one of 17 languages via Settings → General → Response Language. Title generation and internal search queries stay in English.
- **Sidebar run summaries**: After a titled council or advisor run completes, the sidebar shows a compact line (rounds, critique mode, auto-converge, advisor personas, consensus, search). Sidebar search matches this line.
- **Sidebar conversation cost**: Each sidebar card shows a cumulative cost pill (sum of all assistant run costs in the thread, including follow-ups).
- **Release process documentation**: Added `docs/RELEASE.md` and AGENTS guidance so future maintainers and AI agents create both annotated Git tags and GitHub Releases for public versions.

### Changed
- **Settings auto-save**: All Settings sections now save automatically (debounced). The Save Changes button was removed; API keys still save on successful test.
- **Global provider toggles**: `enabled_providers` and `direct_provider_toggles` now apply to **all** model pickers - Council Setup, Advisor Setup, and Settings. Previously they only affected council model pickers in Settings.
- **Simplified Settings → Council Config**: Removed council member/chairman model selection, "I'm Feeling Lucky" randomizer, "Show free OpenRouter models only" filter, and related validation from Settings. Model composition is now managed exclusively via the welcome-screen Council Setup. Settings retains provider toggles (now global) and all three temperature sliders (Council Heat, Peer Ranking Heat, Chairman Heat).
- **Provider toggle restructure**: Local (Ollama) is now standalone at the top; all remote providers (OpenRouter, Groq, Custom, Direct Connections) are grouped under a single "Remote APIs" master toggle.
- **Stage 2 Heat moved**: The Peer Ranking temperature slider moved from Council System Prompts (Stage 2 tab) into the Council Config temperature section alongside the other sliders.
- **Sidebar timestamps**: Conversation cards show date and time on separate lines (respects your date format setting).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Advisor live-progress and reconnect UX**: Advisor runs now publish active round/order/completion state through `/api/conversations/{id}/progress`, and the frontend can reconstruct in-flight advisor runs when navigating away and back.
- **Cost token split in the UI and docs**: Run-cost panels now surface total, input, and output token counts separately for council and advisor runs, with reasoning tokens preserved in call details and billed as output where providers report them that way.
- **Council-vs-Advisors guidance**: User and agent docs now clarify that Council is best for direct answers and synthesis, while Advisors are best for tradeoffs, risk reviews, strategy, ethics, prioritization, and real disagreement.

### Changed
- **Landing page mode guidance**: The front page now explains when to use Council versus Advisors with concrete examples, reducing accidental advisor debates for simple answer prompts.
- **Release version alignment**: Backend package metadata, frontend package metadata, lockfile metadata, sidebar version, skill frontmatter, and changelog are aligned for this release.

### Fixed
- **Provider temperature restrictions**: Direct OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and custom OpenAI-compatible calls now omit temperature for models that only accept provider defaults, preventing preflight failures such as unsupported `temperature: 0` or deprecated temperature parameters.
- **Advisor word-limit handling**: Advisor responses that exceed the word-count guidance are now kept and surfaced with a warning instead of being treated as failed model responses.
- **Hidden reasoning cleanup**: Council Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, title generation, and search-query generation strip `<think>` blocks from visible/stored content so reasoning markup does not leak into conversation titles or final answers.
- **Stage 2 detail matrix overflow**: Wide peer-review matrices now use horizontal scrolling with a sticky rater column so larger councils are not visually truncated.
- **Conversation mode tagging**: Conversation history now normalizes/repairs Council vs Advisor modes so sidebar badges consistently render `CNC` and `ADV` with the intended color coding.
- **Custom endpoint OpenCode free-detection now requires the official host**: A user who names a custom endpoint "opencode" but points it elsewhere was being silently zero-cost. The free heuristic now matches `opencode.ai` substring inside `endpoint_url` only - never the configured name or model text. (1B from v0.8.0 review.)
- **OpenCode provider request robustness**: `query()` now sends `stream: False`, asserts the response is `application/json` before parsing, retries 429/timeout/remote-protocol errors with exponential backoff (`MAX_RETRIES=2`, initial delay 1s), and rejects embed/audio/tts model IDs up-front with a clear error (no HTTP call). Matches openrouter/ollama retry behavior. (R2/R3/R4.)
- **Pricing catalog failure-throttle is now race-free**: `_get_pricing_catalog` resets its failure timestamp on a successful refresh so a transient outage doesn't lock the cache for the full throttle window. The `_catalog_failure_until = 0.0` reset runs inside the catalog lock. (R1.)
- **Stage 3 chairman errors are now cost-tracked**: The outer `except` branch in `stage3_synthesize_final` now calls `attach_cost`, so chairman failures appear in the run's `cost_report` with `cost_status: "unknown"` instead of vanishing from the spend summary. (R6.)
- **MCP cost-aggregation is now shape-tolerant**: `the_ai_counsel_mcp.tools.deliberation._combine_cost_report` is now a thin wrapper around the new shared `backend.costs.summarize_buffered_stages` helper. The helper walks the four buffered stage shapes (council stage 1/2/3, iterative debate, advisor debate), `isinstance`-guards lists and dicts at every level, and shares a single bucketing implementation with the backend. (R5 + R7.)
- **`_summarize_calls` math reuses same canonical path**: Replaces ~70 lines of MCP-side bucketing duplication with a call to the same `costs.summarize_buffered_stages` function used in unit tests.
- **MCP settings docs and tool signatures are aligned**: `council_settings` now accepts and returns title/query prompts plus search tuning fields (`search_provider`, keyword extraction mode, result count, hybrid search, and full-content fetch count), matching the MCP docs and frontend settings.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **OpenCode Zen and OpenCode Go as direct providers** - Two new council model sources, addressing [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai) without going through OpenRouter.
  - Prefixes: `opencode-zen:` (Zen dispatch) and `opencode-go:` (Go dispatch).
  - v1 scope: chat/completions only. The provider filters each product's `/v1/models` listing to chat-capable model families and drops non-`/chat/completions` endpoints (GPT Responses, Anthropic Messages, per-model Gemini). Multi-protocol support is a future release.
  - Single shared API key field. A user with only a Zen subscription, only a Go subscription, or both on the same key is supported. Go users can also use Zen's free models.
  - Settings → "LLM API Keys" has a new OpenCode subsection with a single "Test & Save" button that validates both products in one call (`POST /api/settings/test-opencode`).
  - `direct_provider_toggles` now defaults `opencode-zen` and `opencode-go` to `false` (Council-only; Advisor model pickers ignore these toggles, per AGENTS.md).
  - Cost attribution: hardcoded pricing table in `backend/costs.py` (`_OPENCODE_PRICING`, `_OPENCODE_FREE_MODELS`) reports `pricing_source: "table:opencode"` for paid models and `pricing_source: "free:opencode"` for the four known-free Zen models (big-pickle, deepseek-v4-flash-free, mimo-v2.5-free, nemotron-3-super-free). Go's published per-1M prices are surfaced with a "subscription" note and `cost_status: "estimated"`.
  - Council grid uses a new `opencode.svg` icon and a dedicated `#211E1E` (OpenCode brand grey) accent. Prefix detection is ordered before generic `gpt`/`claude` substring fallbacks in `councilGridUtils.js`.

- **Run cost reporting**: Council, iterative debate, advisor debate, REST, and MCP responses now include per-call usage/cost metadata plus a summarized `cost_report` by model and stage. The UI shows a compact run-cost panel with token totals, call counts, pricing confidence, and model breakdowns.
- **Pricing catalog integration**: Added cached pricing lookups from `ai-model-pricing.com` with LiteLLM pricing as fallback. Known-free Ollama, NVIDIA, OpenRouter `:free`, and OpenCode custom endpoints report `$0`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

**Multi-Round Iterative Council Debate** - Contributed by **@manavgup** ([PR #11](https://github.com/jacob-bd/llm-council-plus/pull/11), building on his earlier iterative debate foundation):

- **Multi-Round Debate Orchestration**: Models debate across configurable rounds (1-5), refining answers based on peer feedback with convergence detection and early stopping.
- **Three Critique Modes**: "Free-form" (open-ended feedback), "Paragraph-level" (per-paragraph structured evaluation with stable `[Para N]` markers), and "Claim-level" (per-claim canonical extraction and verdict mapping).
- **Canonical Claim Extraction & Verification**: Chairman model decomposes responses into falsifiable claims; peer models evaluate each claim with color-coded verdicts (strong/weak/flawed). Includes JSON extraction and repair utilities for robust LLM structured output parsing.
- **Cross-Pollination**: Per-model personalized prompts - each model receives its own critiques plus top-rated claims from peers for adoption in subsequent rounds.
- **ClaimCards UI**: Expandable cards grouped by source model with per-evaluator verdicts, contested-first layout, and evolution timeline.
- **Stateful Interactive Round Selector**: `.round-navigator` in the frontend for clicking and navigating individual debate rounds retroactively.
- **Stage 4: Corrected Draft**: Post-debate rewriting stage where the chairman synthesizes the final corrected draft, highlighting `[REVISED]` or `[NEW]` components.
- **Debate Settings UI**: Critique mode radio buttons with cost hints, round count configuration, convergence settings, and dedicated config section.
- **20 New Tests**: Backend test suites for paragraph mode, claim aggregation, cross-pollination, JSON repair, and multi-round debate orchestration.

**Other additions:**

- **Debate MCP Tools Integration**: Added new `run_iterative_debate` tool (10 MCP tools total) and updated `council_settings` to support critique modes and debate rounds configuration.
- **Live Progress Endpoint**: `GET /api/conversations/{id}/progress` returns real-time progress for active streaming runs (council or debate), including current stage, model counts, and partial responses. Frontend auto-reconnects to in-progress runs when navigating back to a conversation.
- **Custom Endpoint Disconnect**: Settings now includes a "Disconnect" button to clear custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint configuration and disable the provider in one action.

### Changed
- **Chairman Card UX**: Chairman card now always displays the provider logo, model name, and provider label regardless of thinking state. A spinning ring overlay and hourglass badge indicate active processing without replacing the identity information.
- **UTC Timestamps**: Conversation `created_at` timestamps now use timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of naive `utcnow()` with manual `"Z"` suffix.
- **Progress Polling Safety**: Frontend stops progress polling before starting new SSE streams (council or debate) to prevent competing state updates on the same conversation.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Stage 2 Deliberation Heatmap Matrix** (Ported from PR #179 by @UmaimaKhan01): Added a premium, glassmorphic $N \times N$ matrix detailing anonymous peer evaluation grades ( emerald green 1st, soft amber 2nd, modern crimson 3rd, ruby 4th+).
- **Segmented UI View Toggle**: Fully responsive segmented tab switcher (`🏆 Leaderboard` vs `📊 Detail Matrix`) to prevent page clutter and let users swap details dynamically.
- **Auto-Threshold Toggle Control**: Hides the Detail Matrix toggle on low-model runs (less than 3 models) where peer matrices are logically inapplicable, ensuring zero UI clutter.

### Fixed
- **Clean Lazy Creation State Refactor**: Replaced legacy empty file initialization drafts with a pure client-side lazily created draft state (`'draft'`), completely eliminating orphaned JSON file clutter on user disks.
- **Heatmap Score Math Alignment**: Aligned the matrix average scoring calculations exactly with backend leaderboard logic, resolving a visual desync between aggregate scores.
- **Rebuilt Index Mode Desync**: Hardened index indexing logic in the storage layers to read accurate conversation tags (`mode`), correcting mismatched ADV/CNC sidebar badge allocations on legacy items.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **API Key & Model Count Feedback**: Settings panel now queries and displays model counts (e.g. `✓ API key configured · 44 models available`) for OpenRouter, Groq, direct providers, and Ollama in real-time.

### Fixed
- **CORS LAN Access**: Expanded dev CORS regex to allow local network IP connections (e.g., `192.168.x.x`), resolving blank screen settings page loading issues when accessed remotely.
- **Auto-Scrolling in Chat**: Fixed chat scroll positioning during active response generation to instantly scroll to bottom.
- **Conversation Title Overwrite**: Fixed a race condition where council-mode conversation titles were overwritten back to `"New Conversation"` during final assistant message save.
- **Chairman Display Mode Logic**: Fixed the Chairman card showing up in the UI for messages executed in `chat_only` mode by linking the grid layout to the message's specific metadata execution mode rather than the current UI state.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Inline council setup**: Edit council members and chairman on the welcome screen (landing + empty conversation) with auto-save, compact member list (+ Add up to 8), live grid preview, and **council presets** (members + chairman only; default auto-loads).
- **Interactive Council Grid**: Introduced `EditableCouncilGrid` supporting inline slot editing, adding member models up to 8, and quick-swapping models directly on the landing screen.
- **Advisor model presets**: Save and load named advisor setups (selected personas, Simple/Advanced model assignment, optional rounds and web search) from the Model Assignment section in Advisor Setup. Presets persist in `settings.json` via `advisor_presets`.
- **Documentation sync checklist**: [`docs/DOC-SYNC.md`](docs/DOC-SYNC.md) - required file matrix for keeping REST API, MCP tools, skill, and user docs aligned on every change.
- **MCP preset CRUD**: `council_settings` and `advisor_settings` now support `list_presets`, `save_preset`, `delete_preset`, and `set_default_preset` actions.
- **Presets & parsing unit tests**: Added comprehensive backend test suites (`test_advisor_presets.py`, `test_council_presets.py`, `test_ranking_parse.py`) and updated MCP integration tests to verify consolidated 9-tool behavior.

### Changed
- **MCP tool consolidation (breaking)**: Replaced 25 single-purpose MCP tools with **9 action-based tools** - `council_deliberate`, `model_chat`, `advisor_debate`, `council_settings`, `advisor_settings`, `personas`, `conversations`, `providers`, `config_backup`. Legacy names (`run_deliberation`, `get_council_config`, `check_health`, etc.) removed.
- **MCP-first agent routing**: Skill and MCP server instructions tell agents to prefer MCP tools over curl when both are available; REST documented as fallback (`skills/the-ai-counsel-api/SKILL.md`, `the_ai_counsel_mcp/server.py`, `docs/mcp/INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`).
- **Advisor model sources decoupled from Council toggles**: Advisor Setup model pickers list all **configured** providers (API keys, Ollama URL, custom endpoint). Settings → Council Config `enabled_providers` toggles apply to **LLM Council only**.
- **Council Config copy**: Clarifies provider toggles are council-only; advisors always use configured providers from LLM API Keys.
- **New Council navigation**: Sidebar **+ New Council** from advisors mode now switches to council mode (previously stayed on advisor UI).
- **Chairman validation**: Chairman required only for **Full Deliberation**; Chat Only and Chat + Ranking no longer block send without a chairman.
- **Stream API**: Frontend sends `council_models` / `chairman_model` on message stream so the run matches the on-screen lineup.
- **MCP docs sync**: All docs and `skills/the-ai-counsel-api/SKILL.md` updated for **9-tool** MCP catalog; `/api/health` reports `tools: 9`.

### Fixed
- **Stage 2 peer ranking parsing**: Hardened text parser to validate that parsed rankings only include labels actually presented in the prompt, preventing models from hallucinating non-existent labels.
- **Model labeling fixes**: Fixed a bug where anonymous models were incorrectly mapped/labeled during Stage 2 aggregation.
- **Production build crash**: Fixed circular dependency initialization crash in the production bundle by removing rollup `manualChunks`.
- **Direct installation layout lockups**: Standardized `--prefix frontend` usage for all install instructions to avoid nested directory lockups when switching between environments.

### Removed
- **25 legacy MCP tools** - see migration table in `docs/mcp/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Start a New Council Session Button**: Prominent glowing turquoise CTA button placed cleanly below the Council grid row on the home dashboard (only in Council mode), allowing users to easily launch new deliberation sessions.
- **Single-Port MCP SSE Integration**: FastMCP server is now mounted directly onto the main FastAPI web server at `/mcp` on port `8001`. This allows zero-install remote connection via a single port (SSE session endpoint at `/mcp/sse` and JSON-RPC message endpoint at `/mcp/messages`).
- **MCP Auto-Discovery**: The `/api/health` endpoint now includes an `mcp` metadata block advertising the active SSE URL and tool count to help agents auto-register the server.

### Changed
- **Removed Port 8002**: Removed all references, environment variables, mappings, and background process commands for port `8002` since both the REST API and MCP server run on port `8001`.
- **Streamlined Documentation**: Rewrote all 5 MCP docs, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to reflect the single-port architecture.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **LLM Advisors mode**: Entirely new persona-driven debate system where named advisor personas argue your question across configurable rounds, reaching consensus or voting to deliver a structured verdict with action plan
- **10 built-in advisor personas**: The Skeptic, The Pragmatist, The Innovator, The Historian, The Ethicist, The Data Analyst, The Contrarian, The Strategist, The Humanist, and The Risk Assessor - each with unique system prompts, roles, emoji avatars, and color-coded identities
- **Persona customization**: Edit any persona's name, role, description, system prompt, and avatar emoji - overrides persist to `data/persona_overrides.json` with per-persona reset to defaults
- **Debate orchestration** (`backend/advisors.py`): Multi-round debate engine with rotating speaking order, consensus detection via `CONSENSUS:YES/NO` tags, automatic early termination on agreement, and tiebreaker invocation when advisors remain split
- **Structured verdict system**: Neutral analyst synthesizes debate transcript into Summary, Consensus Points, Disagreements table, Verdict, Recommended Next Steps, and Open Uncertainties
- **NVIDIA NIM provider** (`backend/providers/nvidia.py`): Native support for NVIDIA Build (NIM) models at `integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` with `nvidia:` prefix routing, API key management, and model listing
- **Landing page** (`LandingPage.jsx`, `LandingPage.css`): New dual-mode entry screen with animated glass cards for "Enter Council" and "Start Advisory Session", custom SVG icons, gradient orbs, and grid background
- **Advisor Setup UI** (`AdvisorSetup.jsx`, `AdvisorSetup.css`): Full configuration panel with question input, model selection via `SearchableModelSelect`, round count slider, web search toggle, persona selection grid with inline editing, and glassmorphic styling
- **Debate View UI** (`DebateView.jsx`, `DebateView.css`): Live debate display with per-round sections, persona-colored response cards, consensus banners, tiebreaker section, verdict panel with copy-to-clipboard, and streaming progress indicators
- **Advisor Grid** (`AdvisorGrid.jsx`, `AdvisorGrid.css`): Visual grid showing active debate participants with round progress and active-speaker highlighting
- **Advisor API endpoints**: `POST /api/advisor/debate/stream` (SSE streaming debate), `GET /api/personas` (list all personas), `PATCH /api/personas/{id}` (save overrides), `DELETE /api/personas/{id}/override` (reset to default)
- **Advisor conversation persistence**: `add_advisor_message()` in storage saves full debate transcripts (rounds, verdict, tiebreaker, persona IDs) alongside existing council conversations
- **Advisor settings**: `advisor_default_model` and `advisor_default_rounds` fields in settings with validation (1-10 rounds, 2-4 advisors per debate)
- **NVIDIA SVG icon** (`frontend/src/assets/icons/nvidia.svg`) with provider detection in `CouncilGrid.jsx`
- **Complete MCP documentation rewrite** (`docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`): Exposes all **25 tools** across 5 categories, with full parameter listings and JSON output examples (including 11 new tools previously missing from docs)
- **Advisor MCP examples** (`docs/mcp/EXAMPLES.md`): Added 3 comprehensive walkthrough examples covering running advisor debates, customizing/resetting personas via tools, and configuring global advisor preferences
- **Quickstart Advisor Integration** (`docs/QUICKSTART.md`): Added complete walkthroughs for configuring and running the first Advisor debate, custom personas tips, and mode comparison matrix

### Changed
- **App architecture**: `App.jsx` refactored to support dual-mode routing - landing page → council mode or advisors mode, with independent state management for each
- **Sidebar**: Updated to show mode-aware conversation list with Home button navigation back to landing page
- **`SearchableModelSelect`**: Now normalizes dashes to spaces during search so NVIDIA model names (e.g., `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1`) match correctly
- **CouncilGrid provider detection**: NVIDIA prefix (`nvidia:`) added to provider icon lookup chain
- **Settings UI**: NVIDIA API key section added to Provider Settings with test/save flow
- **`ChatInterface`**: Extended to support both council and advisor question submission flows
- **`the-ai-counsel-api` skill updated to v0.5.0**: Documents advisor endpoints, persona API, NVIDIA provider, and dual-mode architecture
- **Main README expanded**: Updated MCP Server details to cover dual-mode capability (Council + Advisors) and all 25 tools
- **Skill Reference expanded** (`skills/the-ai-counsel-api/SKILL.md`): Added extensive examples for custom OpenAI endpoint configuration (OpenCode Zen), hybrid local/cloud council setups, and per-persona model assignment walkthroughs

### Removed
- **Outdated binary assets**: Cleaned up stale PNG screenshots (`header.png`, `landing_page.png`, `debate_page.png`) from repository root
- **Git status noise**: Added `.antigravitycli/` config directories to `.gitignore`

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **AGENTS.md canonical agent guide**: Single source of truth for AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) working in this repository - replaces scattered instructions across CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md
- **Admin endpoint security** (PR #9): `/api/settings/export`, `/api/settings/import`, and `/api/settings/reset` now require `LLM_COUNCIL_ADMIN_TOKEN` when accessed by remote or proxied clients. Direct loopback clients are still allowed without a token. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!

### Changed
- **Jina Reader fetch hardening** (PR #9): Stricter URL validation before fetching full article content via Jina Reader. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!
- **Docker entrypoint escaping** (PR #9): Config values injected into `config.js` are now properly escaped to prevent shell injection. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!
- **Docs reconciliation** (PR #10): CLAUDE.md slimmed to a pointer at AGENTS.md; stale GEMINI.md archived to `docs/archive/`. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!
- **Admin security variables documented**: `LLM_COUNCIL_ADMIN_TOKEN` usage added to AGENTS.md and `docs/DOCKER.md`
- **Custom endpoint error messages improved**: Timeout and connection errors now display actionable messages (e.g., "Request timed out after 120s") instead of "Unknown error"

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **`POST /api/ask` one-shot endpoint**: Single call, no conversation state, returns JSON directly. Accepts `models`, `chairman_model`, `web_search`, and `execution_mode`. Ideal for scripts and MCP agents.
- **`POST /api/conversations/{id}/message` sync endpoint**: Non-streaming JSON alternative to SSE. Saves to conversation history without requiring event stream parsing.
- **Per-request model overrides**: `council_models` and `chairman_model` fields on both streaming and sync message endpoints. Never mutates global config for ad-hoc queries.
- **`PipelineResult` dataclass**: Shared orchestration helper (`_run_council_pipeline`) eliminates duplicated stage1/2/3 collection logic across sync endpoints.
- **Multi-turn conversation memory**: Conversation endpoints pass full prior chat history to models. Follow-up questions carry context automatically.
- **MCP `chat` tool**: Multi-turn equivalent of `quick_chat` - pass `conversation_id` to continue a conversation with memory. (14 tools total)
- **UI: single-model council support**: Council members can now be reduced to 1 in the Settings UI (was minimum 2).
- **UI: chairman auto-disables**: Chairman section dims and becomes non-interactive when execution mode is not "Full Deliberation".

### Changed
- **Minimum council models reduced to 1**: Single-model queries are now valid for any execution mode (was 2 minimum).
- **`execution_mode` uses `Literal` type**: Pydantic rejects invalid values at parse time instead of runtime checks in each handler.
- **Settings cache**: `get_settings()` now uses mtime-based caching - repeated calls within the same request return the cached instance instead of re-reading disk (eliminates 5-10 redundant file reads per deliberation).
- **Storage I/O reduced**: `add_user_message()` and `add_assistant_message()` accept pre-loaded `conversation` kwarg, avoiding redundant reads after 404 checks.
- **Web search setup deduplicated**: Shared `_apply_search_env()` and `_fetch_search_context()` helpers replace 3 copy-pasted blocks (also fixes missing Serper env var in sync/oneshot paths).
- **Dead import removed**: `from .search import perform_web_search, SearchProvider` removed from `council.py` (unused there).
- **MCP `quick_chat` uses `/api/ask`**: No more save/restore of global settings - calls one-shot endpoint directly.
- **MCP `run_deliberation` uses per-request overrides**: Passes `council_models` in stream body instead of mutating settings with try/finally restore.
- **MCP client `ask()` method added**: `CouncilClient.ask()` wraps `POST /api/ask` for one-shot queries.
- **MCP client `stream_message` accepts overrides**: `council_models` and `chairman_model` params added to avoid settings mutation.
- **`the-ai-counsel-api` skill updated to v0.4.1**: Documents `/api/ask`, per-request overrides, sync endpoint, multi-turn conversations, SSE event table, and "Choosing the Right Endpoint" decision matrix.
- **`DEFAULT_EXECUTION_MODE` constant**: Extracted shared default (`'full'`) to `api.js` - eliminates magic string duplication across `App.jsx`, `Settings.jsx`, `CouncilConfig.jsx`.
- **`.subsection--disabled` CSS class**: Replaces inline opacity/pointer-events with reusable class (consistent with `.source-disabled`).
- **Chairman `SearchableModelSelect` respects disabled state**: `isDisabled` prop wired so keyboard users cannot change chairman when irrelevant.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Settings export/import/reset endpoints**: `GET /api/settings/export` returns a full settings backup including actual API key values; `POST /api/settings/import` restores from a backup blob; `POST /api/settings/reset` wipes all settings to factory defaults
- **4 new MCP tools** (17 total): `set_api_key` - set any provider API key by name; `export_config` - backup full config as JSON; `import_config` - restore config from JSON string; `reset_config` - factory reset
- **Extended `configure_council` MCP tool**: now accepts `stage1_prompt`, `stage2_prompt`, `stage3_prompt`, `enabled_providers`, and `direct_provider_toggles` in addition to existing parameters
- **Sidebar delete button always visible**: trash icon now shows at 40% opacity on all conversations (was hover-only), brightens to full on hover
- **18 new tests**: backend export/import/reset endpoint tests, MCP tool tests for all new tools, and client method tests (108 total, up from 90)

### Changed
- **`the-ai-counsel-api` skill updated to v0.4.0**: documents system prompt fields, `enabled_providers`/`direct_provider_toggles` dict formats, all API key field names, and backup/restore endpoints
- **`import_settings` endpoint simplified**: uses Pydantic body parsing (`Settings` model) instead of manual JSON parsing - FastAPI now returns field-level 422 validation errors instead of generic 400s
- **`export_settings` endpoint**: uses `model_dump_json()` (single-pass) instead of `model_dump()` + `json.dumps()` (two-pass)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **MCP server** (`the_ai_counsel_mcp/`): Expose The AI Counsel as a Model Context Protocol server, letting Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients send questions to the council and retrieve deliberation results programmatically
- **13 MCP tools**: `list_models`, `get_council_config`, `configure_council`, `set_search_provider`, `run_stage1`, `run_stage2`, `run_stage3`, `run_deliberation`, `quick_chat`, `list_conversations`, `get_conversation`, `check_health`, `test_provider`
- **stdio transport** (default): MCP server runs as a local process; AI tools communicate via stdin/stdout with outbound HTTP to the Council backend (local or remote)
- **SSE transport**: MCP server runs as an HTTP server on port 8002; AI tools connect via URL with no local installation required
- **TinyFish search provider**: 5th web search option using TinyFish's free-tier Fetch API (5 req/min); requires free API key from agent.tinyfish.ai
- **90 tests**: backend TinyFish provider tests, MCP integration tests covering all 13 tools and both transport modes
- **`docs/mcp/`**: Comprehensive MCP documentation including transport selection guide, step-by-step setup for stdio and SSE, full tools reference, and real-world usage examples
- **`the-ai-counsel-api` Claude Code skill** (`skills/the-ai-counsel-api/SKILL.md`, v0.3.0): Installable skill for interacting with the Council via REST API without MCP - covers all endpoints, SSE parsing, error handling, and troubleshooting

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Docker support** (PR #5): Single-container deployment via `docker compose up -d --build` serving both frontend and API on port 8001. Thanks @kcelsi!
- **Docker healthcheck**: Backend liveness polling via `/api/health` every 30s with automatic restart on failure
- **Non-root container user**: Container now runs as `appuser` for reduced attack surface
- **`docs/` directory**: New structured documentation folder
- **`docs/DOCKER.md`**: Comprehensive Docker deployment guide covering environment variables, persistent storage, Ollama integration, reverse proxy setup (nginx/Caddy with SSE notes), upgrades, and troubleshooting

### Changed
- **CORS hardening**: Dev-ports regex (`5173|5174|3000`) is now suppressed when the built frontend is present (Docker/production mode) - same-origin deployments no longer expose API to external dev-port origins
- **Root cleanup**: Removed stub `main.py`; moved `QUICKSTART.md` and `TEST_PLAN_SEARCH.md` into `docs/`
- **README**: Docker section condensed to quick-start + link to `docs/DOCKER.md`; stale CORS description updated

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **Ollama Configuration**: Fixed an issue where the "Local (Ollama)" toggle was disabled even when Ollama was connected (PR #4). Thanks @patrickgamer!

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Serper.dev Integration**: Google Search via Serper API with 2,500 free queries
- **DuckDuckGo Search Optimization**: Intelligent query processing with intent detection, hybrid web+news search, and relevance reranking
- **Search Settings**: Configurable result count (5-15) and hybrid mode toggle for DuckDuckGo
- **Query Intent Detection**: Automatically detects current events, factual, comparison, and research queries
- **Auto-save Council Config**: Council members and chairman selections now auto-save (no more forgetting to click Save)
- **Council Validation**: Prevent saving incomplete configurations (empty member slots or missing chairman)

### Changed
- **Improved Font Readability**: Switched markdown headers and model names from stylized 'Syne' to readable 'Plus Jakarta Sans'
- **Search Query Processing**: DuckDuckGo now automatically removes conversational fluff and adds temporal context
- **Search Provider Auto-switch**: Testing a search API key now auto-saves and switches to that provider

### Fixed
